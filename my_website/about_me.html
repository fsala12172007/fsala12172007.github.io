    	<p>	Greetings!, my name is Favian Salas and I am currently enrolled at the Fremont Academy of Engineering and Design in Pomona, California. As a student of Fremont, my favorite curriculum are Computer Science, English, History, Psychology, and Spanish Literature. However, along with curriculum, my largest passion at school is being a member of the Debate Club since 2015. Notwithstanding, besides school, my favorite hobbies are cycling, golfing, hiking, reading, and spending time with my dog. </p>
    	
    	<p>Since 2014, I acquired the following achievements:
    	
    	4 Perfect Attendence Semester Awards
    	2 4.0 GPA Awards (Spring 2014, 2015, and 2016)
    	2 3.5-3.99 GPA Awards (Fall 2014 and 2015)
    	4 Citizenship Awards
